# itertoolspython
#This repository contains code for itertools functions (combinations,permutations and combinations with replacement) in python
#i have included the code for all three of the possibities, this builtin function reduces a lot of effort and escapes a lot of switch cases 
# and for loop oriented lenghty code.
#i hope this helps, pull request of you have a better solution to the same
